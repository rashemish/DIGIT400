        <h3>BIO:</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Raashee Mishra, and I am a Digital Media, Arts, and Technology student in my senior year of undergrad at Penn State Behrend. For my research project in my Digital Project Production class, I am researching Data Privacy and how it affects the careers of designers, such as myself.
        </p>
        
        <h3>PROPOSAL:</h3>
        <p>For my topic, I have chosen Data Privacy. Specifically, how the importance and gravity of data privacy is slowly dwindling in the UI/UX design world in order to advance the efficiency of UI/UX design towards users. I want to be able to explain several aspects of this topic through analyzing data privacy breach cases, understanding how to incorporate ethical design practices from guides in my own projects, and argumentative essays about data privacy in general.</p>
        
        <h3>ZOTERO:</h3>
        <p>For more insight into my sources, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/groups/6198434/d4_rm_data_privacy__design  ">here is a guide to my Zotero!</a></p>
        
        <h2>WHY DO WE NEED DATA PRIVACY?</h2>
        <p>Before answering why we need data privacy, let’s establish what data privacy is. 
        </p>
        <p>As the guide from Usercentrics GmbH outlines, the right an individual has to regulate how their own information (data) is accumulated, utilized, and distributed is data privacy.  When this control is neglected, the outcome can be severe: identity theft or fraud for users, and regulatory, reputational or financial consequences for businesses.
        </p>
        <p>As a designer, this means privacy must be integrated into the product and experience from the start, not tacked on afterward. Designers influence how consent is pursued, how data flows are represented, how defaults are set and then play a critical role in aligning user experience with regulatory demands and ethical expectations. 
        </p>
        <p>By embedding clarity, transparency and user-control into design, you reduce user friction, build trust, and avoid the kinds of pitfalls that turn privacy failures into product-failures.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://usercentrics.com/guides/data-privacy/data-privacy-examples/">The guide</a> shows examples where even large platforms failed because consent was unclear, data processing vulnerable, or analyzing systems uncontrolled. I personally took this guide to heart as it really gave insight into how data privacy is practiced in the field my career happens to be in.
        </p>
